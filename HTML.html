			  <p>In astronomy I learned that space and time are not separate but joined together into something he called space-time. In general relativity Einstein theorized that the laws of physics are dependent on gravity because space and time are bent by mass. He found that while Newtonian physics worked here on earth, Newton's calculations could not be trusted under circumstances different from those on earth. Objects like blackholes, the sun, and even the earth change the fabric of space and time. As space and time exist closer to a massive object space and time behave differently. This is seen most clearly in the event horizon of a blackhole where space and time appear to end.</p>
			  
			<p>I step through the metal detector.</p>
			
			<p>The guard asks, "What's your name?" </p>
			
			<p>"Lauren Ziminski."</p>
			<p>"Here to see Luke Ziminski?"</p>
			<p>"Yes."</p>
			<p>The guard checks something off on his clipboard and motions me through a door. I wait in a vestibule. My parents come in soon after and we wait against the wall together. Once all the visitors are in, the guards open the door that leads to the dual-purpose cafeteria/visitation area.</p>
			</p>My father picks out a table that sits out of the way. My mother voices her disapproval of his table selection. She doesn’t like the way they fake wood laminate is peeling apart. My father and I roll our eyes and sit at the table anyway because it promises to be quieter than the others. A wall slightly sections it off from the other tables, and it’s on the far side of the room next to large glass windows and a door that leads to a small courtyard. The other families choose their tables, and their respective inmates come and sit with them. My brother doesn’t come out. 
			I look through the windows and into the courtyard. A few grills and some chairs are arranged on a brick patio. It would be cheery if not for the overcast afternoon sky and the 8-foot wall topped with razor wire.</p>
			<p>My mother and father’s eyes perk up. I turn my head to see what they turned their heads to look at. My brother approaches the table with his usual swagger, leaning slightly more on his right leg than his left. His yellow over shirt signifies that he has been there for more than a month but less than three. He wears a blue thermal undershirt is long enough to cover his full-length sleeve tattoo. Regardless, I can tell that he gained his muscle mass back. He always says, 'If you’re not in pain when you work out, you’re just exercising.'</p>
			<p>Each of us stand as he gets closer. He greets us as he always does, with a side hug. This time he doesn’t smile. He sits down next to me and we face the courtyard together. My father asks him what took so long. He yawns and mumble, “I just woke up.”</p>
			<p>Whenever we ask questions he gives one-word answers. He just sits there. I’ve always been the more talkative of the two of us, but he barely says a word. I make up for this by talking even more than usual. I tell him about the classes I was preparing to take in the coming semester and what I’m expecting from each and every one of them. He stares blankly down at the table and doesn’t interact with us. No matter how hard I try. No matter how much I talk he won't and I, for once, run out of things to say.</p>
			<p>"What's wrong Luke?" my mom asks.</p>
			<p>"I'm angry," he answers.</p>
			<p>“Why?”</p>
			<p>“I’m in here.”</p>
			<p>My mother explains to him that it could be worse and that this place isn’t so bad.</p>
			<p>And it isn’t that bad. Not compared to some of the other places he has been. At least here he can go outside and doesn’t have to survive off shitty commissary food. There haven’t even been any fights, and the place seems relatively clean.</p>
			<p>He nearly yells, “I’d trade places with any one of you,”
			My father and I sit back in our respective dual-purpose cafeteria/visitation chairs. For a moment we all become silent. Time slows down. The gleam of the speckled cream tile fades into the background. I begin to sink into myself. My brother is right.</p>
			<p>My mother means well. I know she is trying to cheer him up, but I hope my mother will back down. I hope she will stop trying to get my brother to look at the bright side and just accept him where he is. To accept that he lives in a different reality from her, or any of us. To accept that incarceration brings pain that none of us could ever understand quite like he does.</p>
			<p>But she doesn’t. She continues, “Would you rather be in Jackson Pike?”</p>
			<p>"I'm not home. I'm not free!" His words reverberate off the hard tile and the glass windows that lead to the courtyard. They bounced back and struck my parents, but they were imprinted in me.</p>
			<p>In astronomy I learned that if I was to observe a spaceship fall into a supermassive blackhole the lights of the spaceship would slowly become redder and flash slower as the spaceship got closer to the event horizon. Then I would see the spaceship fade away slowly long after it crossed the event horizon. But I would still be able to escape the gravity of the blackhole.
